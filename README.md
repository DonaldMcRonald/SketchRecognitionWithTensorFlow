# tensorFlowRecognition
Uses tensorflow for sketch recognition

Requirements to run this:
Java 1.8
Maven
Python:
    Pip
    Numpy
    Tensorflow
    Matplotlib
Ubuntu/Mac/BashOnWindows*

To install tensorflow follow this guide:
https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.8/get_started/os_setup.html
I suggest using pip to install

You need to install numpy via pip and you need to install matplotlib.

After you install all python dependencies you can run maven and it will install all required Java libraries.

You can run python (python file) to run any file you want.


*to run on Windows you must be in Windows 10 developer preview and have bashonwindows installed and run it in there.

You should be able to run and test all code in python as the Java library is just to make it connect to other libraries easier.
